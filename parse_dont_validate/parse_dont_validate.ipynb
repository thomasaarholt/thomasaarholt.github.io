    "There's an [excellent post](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/) on using types in order to make guarantees about your data called \"[Parse, don't validate](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/)\", from 2019. If you haven't, go read it! The code examples it uses are written in Haskell, and while that may feel strange to you, the post really is worth reading (and coming back to as you mature)."
