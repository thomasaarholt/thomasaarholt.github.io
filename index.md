Hi, I'm Thomas. I'm a data scientist working at Oda, a Norwegian online grocery delivery company.

I did a PhD at the University of Oxford, investigating how nuclear reactors corrode using nanotechnology and electron microscopy.
I love contributing the open source - mainly in Python - you might find making issues and PRs all over the data science space on github.

I also contribute to the Hyperspy project.
